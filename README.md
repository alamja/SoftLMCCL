Cellular  Electron  Cryo-Tomography  (CECT)  is  a  3D  imaging  tool  that  visualizesthe structure and spatial organization of macromolecules at sub-molecular resolution ina near native state,  allowing systematic analysis of seen and unseen macromolecules.Methods for high-throughput subtomogram classification on known macromolecules basedon deep learning have been developed.  However, the learned features guided by eitherthe regular Softmax loss or traditional feature descriptors are not well applicable in theopen-set recognition scenarios where the testing data and the training data have a differ-ent label space.  In other words, the testing data contain novel structural classes unseenin the training data.  In this paper, we propose a novel loss function for deep neural net-works to extract discriminative features for unseen macromolecular structure recognitionin CECT, called Soft Large Margin Centralized Cosine Loss (Soft LMCCL). Our SoftLMCCL projects 3D images into a normalized hypersphere that generates features witha large inter-class variance and a low intra-class variance, which can better generalizeacross data with different classes and in different datasets.  Our experiments on CECTsubtomogram recognition tasks using both simulation data and real data demonstrate thatwe are able to achieve significantly better verification accuracy and reliability comparedto classic loss functions. In summary, our Soft LMCCL is a useful design in our detectiontask of unseen structures and is potentially useful in other similar open-set scenarios
